# AST1100 - Introduction to astrophysics

This repository contains coursework from the course  AST1100 - Introduction to astrophysics at the University of Oslo, which I undertook in the autumn semester of 2016.

A full description of the project can be found in the notes folder. My source code is in the src folder, and the final report is in the PDF file.

I cannot guarantee that everything is entirely correct.

This entire project was based on an idea by [Frode Hansen](https://www.mn.uio.no/astro/personer/vit/frodekh/) at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics, University of Oslo. He, together with [Robert Hagala](https://www.mn.uio.no/astro/english/people/aca/roberhag/) wrote the course notes and the code contained in the provided_code folder.

The course interfaced heavily with the visualization program [MCAst](https://www.irio.co.uk/MCAst/) available from https://www.irio.co.uk/MCAst/.
