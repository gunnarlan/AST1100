# AST1100 - Introduction to astrophysics/Notes

These notes were written by [Frode Hansen](https://www.mn.uio.no/astro/personer/vit/frodekh/) at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics, University of Oslo, and [Robert Hagala](https://www.mn.uio.no/astro/english/people/aca/roberhag/). I do not take any credit for them, and only include them for completeness.
